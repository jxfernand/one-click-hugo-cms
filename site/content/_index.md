    "The Future is shaped by our present thinking. this is my philosophy, put
    into daily practice; so my future is firmly set in mind. The one thing
    remaining is to set free my future, perhaps similar to a sculptor who first
    envisage his art, and then realizes it"

    base on this philosophy it bring me to the three competence that owned by me:

    1. Self Development, Initiative-taking

    2. Be able to do multi-task and meet deadlines

    3. Be able to Work in multi-culture environment"

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
